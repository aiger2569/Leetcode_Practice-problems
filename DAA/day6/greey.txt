6.1 Aim of the program: Given an undirected weighted connected graph G(V, E) and starring
vertex „s‟. Maintain a Min-Priority Queue „Q‟ from the vertex set V and apply Prim‟s algorithm
to
● Find the minimum spanning tree T(V, E‟). Display the cost adjacency matrix of „T‟.
● Display total cost of the minimum spanning tree T.
Note# Nodes will be numbered consecutively from 1 to n (user input), and edges will have
varying weight. The graph G can be read from an input file “inUnAdjMat.dat” that contains cost
adjacency matrix. The expected output could be displayed as the cost adjacency matrix of the
minimum spanning tree and total cost of the tree.

Content of the input file “inUnAdjMat.dat” could be

6.2 Aim of the program: Given an undirected weighted connected graph G(V, E). Apply
Krushkal‟s algorithm to
●Find the minimum spanning tree T(V, E‟) and Display the selected edges of G.
● Display total cost of the minimum spanning tree T.
Note# Nodes will be numbered consecutively from 1 to n (user input), and edges will have
varying weight. The weight matrix of the graph can be represented from the user‟s input in the
given format. The expected output could be the selected edge and the corresponding cost of the
edge as per the sample output.
Input Format:
●The first line contains two space-separated integers „n‟ and „m‟, the number of nodes and
edges in the graph.

●Each line „i‟ of the „m‟ subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers „u‟, „v‟
and „w‟, that describe an edge (u, v) and weight „w‟.
